EZ Command and Control Agent
Objective is to create a program/script that will reach out to a C&C Server to obtain commands
This program should also be able to exfil data

Current goal is to make a script that:
A) reaches out to a C&C (either scp, ssh or directly to a webpage)
    - Currently via webpage
B) Receive commands needed
    - Currently checks webpage for command
C) perform commands
    - Executes commands
D) send results back to C&C server (part 1 of exfil)
    - Sends results back by base64 encode and post request to webpage
E) send files back to C&C server (csv, txt, or w/e)
F) takes screenshots and sends back to the attacker

## UPDATES
######

v0.2 
    - Added HTTPS
    - Modified Run Command to use "DownloadString" for "GET" instead of Invoke Web Request
    - Mofified Upload (victim to attacker) to use "UploadString" for POST request
    - Modified Screenshot to use UploadString for PUT request

v0.3
    - Updated server for /ServerRequirements/ Directory for portability

v0.3.1
    - TODO: Add an enumeration script
	- Pull down the script from CNC server, run the script, save output and send output back to CNC server
	- TODO: Maybe make it run the script in memory? Or download script, run and then delete?
