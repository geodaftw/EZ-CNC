# EZ CnC

This is a project I created to demonstrate how a Command and Control (C&C) Server and Agent communicate. The server runs python and stands up a web server. A powershell script (generated with config.py) needs to be deployed and ran on the victim machine. This will then loop the script and communicate with the CnC server for its tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This has been created and tested with Python 2.7.
TODO: Port to Python 3

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Usage

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Create the Victim Powershell agent

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

Once you deploy the powershell agent and its running, you can start the server

### Starting the CnC Server

Explain what these tests test and why
